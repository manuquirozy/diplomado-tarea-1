            <p>Hogwarts Legacy is a 2023 action role-playing game developed by Avalanche Software and published by
                Warner Bros. Games under its Portkey Games label. The game, part of the Wizarding World franchise, takes
                place in the late 1800s, a century prior to the events chronicled in the Harry Potter novels. The player
                controls a student enrolled in the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry who learns to wield an
                array of magical abilities and objects. With the assistance of fellow students and professors, the
                protagonist embarks on a journey to unearth an ancient secret concealed within the wizarding world.
            </p>
            <p>Following their acquisition by Warner Bros. in 2017, Hogwarts Legacy marks the first release from
                Avalanche unrelated to Disney Interactive Studios and its products. The game's development commenced in
                2018, while pre-release gameplay footage was leaked onto the internet in the same year. The storyline
                was crafted to unfold in a period untouched by established Wizarding World characters, offering players
                the opportunity to immerse themselves in their own distinct universe. Avalanche Software emphasised that
                while their rendition of Hogwarts is their own interpretation, it had been carefully designed to
                maintain a sense of familiarity and recognition.
            </p>
            <p>When first officially announced in 2020, the game garnered significant anticipation. Prior
                to its release, it attracted controversy due to Harry Potter creator J. K. Rowling's views on
                transgender people and accusations of including antisemitic tropes, leading to calls for a boycott.
                Following some delays, it was released on 10 February 2023 for PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series
                X/S and on 5 May 2023 for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. It is scheduled for release on Nintendo Switch in
                November 2023. The early-access period of Hogwarts Legacy resulted in record-breaking viewership on
                streaming platform Twitch, making it the most-watched single-player game of all time on the platform.
            </p>
            <p>Within two weeks after its launch, the game sold more than 12 million copies and generated $850 million
                in global sales revenue. As of 5 May 2023, revenue crossed $1 billion and 15 million copies were sold
                globally. Hogwarts Legacy received generally favourable reviews from critics, with praise for its
                combat, world design, characters, and faithfulness to the source material, but criticism for its
                technical problems and lack of innovation as an open-world game.
